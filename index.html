  <p>Welcome to the lab! Here are some general resources that will be useful when you're working on projects. You don't need to know all of this by heart, the purpose is to give you a general sense of what is going on. Look below for topics that are most relevant to your project.<p>

  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="TE">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Transposable Elements</h3>
  </div>
  <p>A major focus of research in the lab are a part of the genome called <b>transposable elements</b>, particulary one type of transposable element called the <b>DNA transosable elments</b>. Here are some ressources to find out more about these.<p></li>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Two video lectures by Dr. Sue Wessler at UC Riverside introducing transposable elements: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJfsWYR42M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Video 1</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOXvZXtc93U">Video 2</a></p>
    <li><p>Here is a manuscript by Martín Muñoz-López and José L. García-Pérez introducing transposable elements: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2874221/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">manuscript</a><p></li>
  </ul>
    <!-- Communication Section -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="communication">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Lab communication & record keeping</h3>
  </div>
  <p>The lab communicates largely via <a href="https://element.io/app-for-productivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Element</a>. You'll need me to create a space for you there and send you an invitation. One important reason for this is that such communication keeps a written record of what's been accomplished and how it's been done. When it comes time to publish data it's very important that good records are kept so everybody knows exactly what's been done. <p>
    <!-- Access Section -->
    <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="access">
      <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Accessing the lab computers & Linux</h3>
    </div>
    <p>This lab, and 99% of all bioinformatics labs use the Linux operating systems rather than Window or Mac OS. Partially it's for historical reasons, but it's also because many of the applications designed for bioinformatics run on Linux. There are a variety of different "flavors" of Linux out there, my preference is for <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ubuntu</a>, but it's just a preference. Below are some details about the computers used in the lab and how to access them.<p>
    <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="access">
      <h4 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Computer Hardware</h4>
    </div>
    <p class="shifted">The lab contains several workstations all running ubuntu. You are welcome to get an account on those workstations and even access them from outside campus (see below). Talk to me if you want to set that up, otherwise you can come by anytime and work in the lab at a computer station. In addition to the lab workstations we also have access to the CPP computer cluster. This is a cluster of high powered computers, used for analysis that is more intense than what can be handled in the lab. If your project needs access to the cluster I can help you get to your account, and you can access it from anywhere. You can also install Linux on your computer, even alongside Windows. See <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for some guidance on that. </p>
    <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="access">
      <h4 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Accessing the Lab Computer</h4>
    </div>
    <p class="shifted">You can access the lab computer (named traviata) via the command line in Windows, MacOS, or a Linux based operating system. There are two things you'll need: 1) an account on the traviata computer, 2) the CPP VPN running if you're not on campus. I will provide you a user name and password for traviata, instructions for getting the VPN running on Windows or MacOS are on the <a href="https://cpp.service-now.com/ehelp?sys_kb_id=c40f854e6fe8e600e020f35d5d3ee4d5&id=kb_article_view&sysparm_rank=3&sysparm_tsqueryId=8daadb9587fa25d04f5098e73cbb35e9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CPP IT website</a>. Once you have an account and the VPN is running you'll need to use a ssh client program to access traviata from home.
    <ul>
      <li><p><b>Windows</b></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">Putty</a> is a popular ssh client. Install the program (instructions <a href="https://cpp.service-now.com/ehelp?sys_kb_id=b80f854e6fe8e600e020f35d5d3ee4f7&id=kb_article_view&sysparm_rank=1&sysparm_tsqueryId=9b9b9f5d87fa25d04f5098e73cbb350a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) and connect to the lab computer by filling in 134.71.67.54 for the host ip. Once connected you'll be asked to enter your user name and password that I will have provided you with.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Mac</b></p>
        <p>You can run an SSH command from the "Terminal" program on a Mac. Run the "Terminal" program and in the command line type "ssh 134.71.67.54". Once connected you'll be asked to enter your user name and password that I will have provided you with.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Linux</b></p>
        <p>The CPP IT department does not support Linux so they don't provide instructions on how to set up the VPN on a Linux machine. However, it's possible to do by installing and running the Global Protect VPN emulator <a href="https://github.com/yuezk/GlobalProtect-openconnect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Once you've got the VPN running, start the program "Terminal" to get the command line interface, and type in "ssh 134.71.67.54" to log into the computer.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <!-- Command lines Section -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="commandlines">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Leaning to use Command Lines</h3>
  </div>
  <p>To communicate with the lab computer you'll need to use Bash shell command lines (don't worry too much about the terminology here, just know that the "Bash shell" is the program on the lab Linux computers that allows you to issue commands). Most of the power of this operating system comes from learning to issue command via the command line. Why? Imagine you want to count the number of times the human genome has the sequence AAATCGC. If you try to open a 3,000,000,000 letter long document in Microsoft Word you'll likely crash your computer. However, issuing the command line below will give you the answer quickly even on a typical laptop computer (provided it runs Linux):<p>
  <p> grep -o "AAATCGC" <i>insert genome file name here</i> | wc -l</p>
  <p>The structure of the command above will take a bit of work to understand, but hopefully you can see how useful command lines can be for bioinformatic work.  <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's</a> a basic tutorial on using a command lines in ubuntu. It's probably best to work through this tutorial once you have a way to access a Linux based machine.</p>

  <!-- Writing scripts Section -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="scripts">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Learning to write scripts</h3>
  </div>
  <p>Script writting is essential for any advanced bioinformatic work. You do not need to known how to script to work in the lab, but if it's something you're thinking about then read on. <p>
  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="scripts">
    <h4 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Which language should I learn?</h4>
  </div>
  <p class="shifted">This is nearly always the first question students ask when they think about learning to program. There’s no one answer, it depends on what you want to achieve. Think of programming languages as a set of tools in a toolbox; all toolboxes can solve basic problems, but some toolboxes are better suited to certain tasks than others. When it comes to bioinformatics, there are a number of programming languages that are commonly used. Three of the most commonly used are listed below along with their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p><b>R</b></p>
      <p><b>Strength</b>: Very popular in many different fields (not just bioinformatic), many existing programs that can be combined to solve specific problem</p>
      <p><b>Weaknesses</b>: Takes a statistical approach to problems which is not always well suited for very large bioinformatic data sets, may take the most time to “get the hang of” of all the languages listed here</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>Python</b></p>
      <p><b>Strength</b>: Currently the most popular introductory programming language</p>
      <p><b>Weaknesses</b>: This language becomes less useful when used for more computationally demanding problem.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>Perl</b></p>
      <p><b>Strength</b>: The best language for manipulation of text (e.g. genome sequences), </p>
      <p><b>Weaknesses</b>: This is not currently a popular language, so not as much demand for it outside of niche specialties</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="shifted">There are many other languages (Java, C, etc.). Once you’ve mastered one programming language it becomes much easier to pick up other ones, most bioinformaticians end up using multiple languages to solve problem in different situations, even when they have a preferred scripting language.</p>
  </p>
  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="scripts">
    <h4 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">I’ve picked a language, now what?</h4>
    <p> Now it’s time learn. There are as many ways to learn how to program, below are some resources but there are many, many others. Pick the one that work best for you. </p>
